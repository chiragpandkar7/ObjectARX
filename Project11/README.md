#include "acedCmdNF.h" Type the following code to define a function named commandAndSysVar:

In the acrxEntryPoint function, make the following addition:

acedRegCmds->addCommand(_T("AUCommands"), _T("CommandAndSysVar"), _T("CommandAndSysVar"), ACRX_CMD_MODAL, commandAndSysVar); Save, build, and load the output.arx file into AutoCAD.
