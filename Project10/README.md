Load the file into AutoCAD.

Try some of the commands defined in the ARX file: UNO, ADDLINE, MAKELAYER, LISTOBJECTS, INPUTLINE, and CHANGECOLOR. The commands should execute as they did before. However, the release version of the ARX file can be copied and executed on other workstations running AutoCAD 2015.
