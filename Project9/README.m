Debugging an ObjectARX Application This exercise guides you through building a project for debugging and debugging the project in Microsoft Visual Studio.

Instructions In Microsoft Visual Studio, navigate to the menu bar and click Build ➔ Configuration Manager.

In the Configuration Manager dialog box, select "Debug" from the Active Solution Configuration drop-down list, and then click Close.

In the source code window, set a breakpoint by clicking in the leftmost margin across from the code line pDb->getSymbolTable(pBlockTable, AcDb::kForRead); in the addLine function.

Note: The breakpoint is where the program will pause, allowing you to step through each line of code during execution.

On the menu bar, click Debug ➔ Start Debugging.

If a Microsoft Visual Studio message box appears, stating "This Project is Out of Date," click Yes to build the project. This message is related to adding the breakpoint to the project. After clicking Yes, Visual Studio will start up AutoCAD 2015.

In the new AutoCAD session, create a new drawing, and then display the Load/Unload Applications dialog box.

In the Load/Unload Applications dialog box, browse to the location of the compiled debug version of the ARX file. Select AU2014.arx and click Load.

In the "File Loading - Security Concern" message box, click Load.

Click Close.

At the Command prompt, type addline and press Enter.

Focus will shift to Microsoft Visual Studio, and the line with the breakpoint will have a yellow arrow next to it, indicating that it is waiting for you to start debugging.

Press F10 to begin stepping through each line of code until the yellow arrow is to the left of the code line pBlockTableRecord->appendAcDbEntity(pLine);.

Hover the cursor over the endPt variable in the line that begins with AcDbLine *pLine to see its current value. Alternatively, use the Watch window, which displays automatically while debugging a project.

Click Debug ➔ Continue to resume normal execution. You are returned to AutoCAD.

Switch back to Microsoft Visual Studio and click Debug ➔ Stop Debugging to end the debugging session.

Unload the output.arx file from AutoCAD.
